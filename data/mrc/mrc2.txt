          The MRC Psycholinguistic Database version 1, was provided as
          an on-line service (see Coltheart, 1981b).  The service drew
          on three files and several access programs. The  first  file
          was  a  dictionary of words, the second and third files were
          sets of word association norms from the Edinburgh Thesaurus.
          The service has now been discontinued.

          This second version of the MRC Psycholinguistic Database  is
          being  provided as a computer usable resource rather than as
          a service. An updated version of the  dictionary  file  from
          the  database  (referred  to here as MRC2.DCT) is being pro-
          vided for public research use along with some programs which
          can  be used either to access the dictionary, or as examples
          on which to  model  programs  which  match  users'  specific
          needs.  This  database dictionary differs from other machine
          usable dictionaries in that it includes not  only  syntactic
          information but also psychological data for the entries (see
          Amsler, 1984 for a review of  other  machine  readable  dic-
          tionaries).  It  also  differs  from  most conventional dic-
          tionaries in that it does not currently attempt  to  provide
          any  semantic  information.  It  is designed to be of use to
          psycholinguists in selecting stimulus materials for testing;
          for  use  by  researchers  in  Artificial  Intelligence as a
          source of information required for natural language process-
          ing and cognitive simulation, and for use by computer scien-
          tists who wish to use the word lists and syntactic  informa-
          tion in the design of text processors.

          The MRC Psycholinguistic Database: Machine Usable Dictionary
          and  utility  programs  are  available for research purposes
          from the Oxford Text Archive as item 1054 on their list at a
          nominal fee to cover handling costs. Their address is:

          The file contains  150837  words  and  provides  information
          about 26 different linguistic properties, although it is not
          the case that information about every property is  available
          for  every one of the 150837 words: nobody, for example, has
          yet collected imagery ratings on such a large set of  words,
          and thus only 9240 of the words possess an imagery rating.

          The dictionary file does not contain any  information  which
          is  original to it, but was assembled by merging a number of
          smaller databases of limited availability:

          a) the tape dictionary of  Dolby,  Resnikoff  and  MacMurray
          (1963)  which  was  created by taking all the left justified
          bold faced words from the Shorter Oxford English  Dictionary
          together  with the parts of speech given by that dictionary.
          In addition, words were taken from  the  Cornell  University
          tape  of 20,000 commonly used words, and the parts of speech
          for all these words found in the third edition of  Webster's
          New International Dictionary.

          b) the Edinburgh Associative  Thesaurus  (Kiss,   Armstrong,
          Milroy and Piper, 1973);

          c) the Colerado Norms (Toglia and Battig, 1978);

          d) the Pavio Norms (unpublished, these are an expansion   of
          the norms of Pavio, Yuille and Madigan, 1968);

          e) the Gilhooly-Logie norms (Gilhooly and Logie, 1980);

          f)  the  Kucera-Francis written   frequency   count  (Kucera
          and Francis, 1967);

          g) the Thorndike-Lorge written  frequency  count  (Thorndike
          and  Lorge, 1944; L count);

          h) the   phonetic   transcriptions   from    Daniel   Jones'
          Pronouncing  Dictionary  of  English  Language, 12th Edition
          (see Guierre, 1966).

          i) 2500 proper names from the Machine Usable Version of  the
          Oxford  Advanced  Learner's  Dictionary (Mitton, 1986) which
          were added to the published version of  the  dictionary  and
          are  not covered by the copyright held by the Oxford Univer-
          sity Press.

          j) The frequency count for spoken English from  the  London-
          Lund  Corpus  of  English  Conversation (Svartvik and Quirk,
          1980; Brown, 1984).

          The dictionary file currently occupies 11 Mbyte as a sequen-
          tial  UNIX file.  Each line of the file represents the field
          for one word. The  longest  entry  is  130  characters.  The
          structure of each entry will be:

          040320021615167000000093057530228435500000       JJ        S
          ABLE|eI/bl|eIbl|20

          The composition of the  dictionary  file  is  summarised  in
          Table 1, which specifies the linguistic properties described
          in an entry.  The first column  of  Table  1  indicates  the

          columns/field  in   the file  containing the data.  The last
          four  properties  are  held  in   variable   length   fields
          separated  by a | character. The second column indicates the
          name of the data field used elsewhere in programs and  docu-
          mentation.   The   third  column specifies the  identity  of
          the  linguistic  property,  and  the fourth column indicates
          the  number of words in  the database  for which information
          about a particular linguistic  property  is  available.  The
          first  fourteen properties are stored in the file as numeri-
          cal values.  For  these  properties,  the  occurrence  count
          refers to the number of non zero entries.

          _#T_#a_#b_#l_#e _#4.  The distribution of syllable counts given by NSYL.

          _#T-_#L-_#F_#R_#E_#Q_#L

          This is the frequency of occurrence as given in the L  count
          of  Thorndike and Lorge (1942). If you plan to use this fre-
          quency count, you are advised to read details  about  it  in
          the  Thorndike -Lorge book. For example, the frequency value
          of a singular word which has a regular plural  _#i_#n_#c_#l_#u_#d_#e_#s  the
          frequency  of  the  plural  form, and this is true for other

          kinds of derivations too.

          _#B_#R_#O_#W_#N-_#F_#R_#E_#Q

          This  stands  for  the  frequency  of  occurence  in  verbal
          language  derived  from  the  London-Lund  Corpus of English
          Conversation by Brown (1984). There are  14529  entries  for
          8985  different  strings  in  the  WORD  field. The range of
          entries is 0 - 6833 with a mean of 35 and a standard  devia-
          tion of 252.

          _#F_#A_#M

          This stands for 'printed familiarity'. The FAM  values  were
          derived  from merging three sets of familiarity norms: Pavio
          (unpublished), Toglia and Battig  (1978)  and  Gilhooly  and
          Logie  (1980). The method by which these three sets of norms
          were merged is described in detail in Appendix 2 of the  MRC
          Psycholinguistic  Database  User  Manual (Coltheart, 1981a).
          This method may  not  meet  with  everyone's  approval.  FAM
          values lie in the range 100 to 700 with the maximum entry of
          657, a mean of 488 and a standard deviation of 99: note that
          they   are   integer  values  (in  the  original  norms  the
          equivalent range was 1.00 to 7.00).

          _#C_#O_#N_#C

          This is concreteness, and it too is derived from  a  merging
          of the Pavio, Colerado, and Gilhooly-Logie norms: details of
          merging are given in  Appendix 2 of the MRC Psycholinguistic
          Database User Manual (Coltheart, 1981a). CONC values are in-
          teger, in the range 100 to 700 (min: 158; max 670; mean 438;
          s.d. 120).

          _#I_#M_#A_#G

          This is imageability, derived from merging the three sets of
          norms  referred to above, and having values in the range 100
          to 700 (min 129; max 669; mean 450; s.d. 108).

          _#M_#E_#A_#N_#C

          These are the meaningfulness ratings  from  the  Toglia  and
          Battig (1978), multiplied by 100 to produce a range from 100
          to 700 (min 127; max 667; mean 415; s.d. 78).

          _#M_#E_#A_#N_#P

          This is the meaningfulness from the norms of  Pavio  (unpub-
          lished)  multiplied  by  100  to produce a range from 100 to
          700. The two sets of meaningfulness ratings were not  merged
          because  their  correlations were low ( only + .529) and the
          mean values for a set of words common to  the  two  sets  of
          norms  were very low (see Toglia and Battig, 1978, Table 2).

                                     - 8 -


          These differences are due to differences in the instructions
          to subjects. Thus the two sets of meaningfulness ratings are
          not comparable, and so were kept seperate (min 192; max 922;
          mean 600; s.d. 107).

          _#A_#O_#A

          This is age of acquisition from the norms  of  Gilhooly  and
          Logie  (1980), multiplied by 100 to produce a range from 100
          to 700 (min 125; max 697; mean 405; s.d. 120).

          _#T_#Q_#2

          When TQ2 has the value Q (40810 occurrences), this word is a
          derivational  varient of another word in the dictionary file
          (e.g. baptist, from baptism). When TQ2 has the value 2 (4166
          occurrences),  the  word  ends in the letter R and this R is
          not pronounced, except when the  next  word  begins  with  a
          vowel.  When  an  entry  should have both values 2 and Q for
          this attribute, Q is given in this field,  and  both  values
          are given in DPHON.

          _#W_#T_#Y_#P_#E

          This is syntactic category as represented in the SOED  data-
          base  assembled  by  Dolby,  Resnikoff and MacMurray (1963).
          There are ten different syntactic categories, coded as shown
          in Table 5.

          _#P_#D_#W_#T_#Y_#P_#E

          When you are interested in  syntactic  category,  WTYPE  can
          sometimes  be  unsatisfactory. For example, the words FREEZE
          and HARASS are Nouns according to WTYPE (as well as  verbs);
          and  indeed  when  these are looked up in SOED or Webster's,
          they are described as nouns.  If  you  want  to  avoid  such

          esoteric  usages,  PDWTYPE  may  be useful. It refers to the
          syntactic categories given in Jones' Pronouncing  Dictionary
          (Jones,  1963),  and very unusual uses of words are not con-
          sidered. However PDWTYPE uses only four categories, not ten:
          these  four  are  noun (N, 22061 occurrences), verb (V, 6333
          occurrences), adjective (J, 8817 occurrences) and other  (O,
          1179  occurrences).  The  mapping  from  WTYPE to PDWTYPE is
          shown in table 6.

          _#A_#L_#P_#H_#S_#Y_#L

          If  this  =  A,  then  the  word  is  an  abbreviation  (130
          occurrences);  if S, the word is a suffix (282 occurrences);
          if P, a  prefix  (1374  occurrences);  if  H,  the  word  is
          hyphenated  (13716  occurrences); if T, a multi-word phrasal
          unit (436 occurrences). For all of these categories, NSYL  =
          0. For all other words ALPHYSL is blank.

          _#S_#T_#A_#T_#U_#S

          The 15 possible categories of STATUS are listed in Table  7;
          these  are  as  given  in  the Dolby database (Dolby et al.,
          1963) derived from the Shorter  Oxford  English  Dictionary,
          and  perusal  of  Table  7 should make the meanings of these
          categories sufficiently clear.

          _#T_#a_#b_#l_#e _#7.  The possible values of STATUS.

          _#V_#A_#R

          This refers to words which have the same spelling  but  dif-
          ferent pronunciation and syntactic classes. When the pronun-
          ciations differ only in respect of stress (e.g. object,  in-
          sult)  VAR  =  O  (212  occurrences).When the pronunciations
          differ phonemically (e.g. moderate, abuse), VAR  =  B  (1233
          occurrences).

          _#C_#A_#P

          If this = C, then the word is normally written with an  ini-
          tial  capital  letter.   This can be used as an indicator of
          proper nouns such as the names of people, towns, states  and
          countries.

          _#I_#R_#R_#E_#G

          This refers to the plurality of words. Where IRREG = Z,  the
          word is plural (17441 occurrences), this can be used in con-
          junction with TQ2  to select irregular forms; where IRREG  =
          Y,  the  word  is  a singular form (1024 occurrences); where
          IRREG = B, the word is both the singular and the plural form
          (151  occurences);  where  IRREG = N, the word has no plural
          form (4407 occurences); where IRREG = P, the word is  plural
          but acts singular (88 occurences)

          The 12th edition of Daniel  Jones's  Pronouncing  Dictionary
          (Jones,  1963) was transferred to magnetic tape by Professor
          L. Guierre (Guierre, 1966). These are used as the  basis  of
          the  phonetic transcriptions in the PHON field. The phonetic
          symbols used on this tape were  adjusted  following  sugges-
          tions from Roger Mitton (see Mitton, 1986) to conform to the
          U.K. Alvey standard for machine readable phonetic transcrip-
          tion  (Wells,  1986).   The changes in phonetic symbols used
          from Coltheart (1981a) made by by  Quinlan  (1986)  include:
          devoiced  consonants  have  been  folded  into  their voiced
          equivalents; Coltheart (1981a) refers to the symbol 3, which
          has  been ditched as no occurrence could be found; I( and U(
          have been mapped into I and  U  respectively.   The  symbols
          currently  used  in PHON field are a '/' character to denote
          syllable boundaries and those presented  in  Table  8  with,
          where   printable,   the   International  Phonetic  Alphabet
          equivalents. The DPHON field uses these symbols without  the
          syllable  distinguisher,  but  with the inclusion of the TQ2
          symbols following the  phonetic  transcription.  DPHON  also
          includes  the following three characters:  - + R. The hyphen
          is used to represent the hyphen in hyphenated spellings. The
          'R'  character  is  used to represent a final R in the first
          part of hyphenated words which  is  only  pronunced  if  the
          second  part  of  a hyphenated word begins with a vowel. The
          '+' sign is used to indicate the division  between  the  two
          parts  of a compound noun written without a space (indicated
          by ALPHSYL = T) or hyphenation (indicated by ALPHSYL = H).

          There are three utility programs  available  to  access  and
          modify  the  dictionary. These are written in the C program-
          ming language for the Unix operating system, but  should  be
          compilable  for  any system with a C compiler. The full UNIX
          manual pages are given in Appendix 2, but a  brief  descrip-
          tion of there functions follows.

          _#d_#i_#c_#t

          The _#d_#i_#c_#t program provides access to the mrc dictionary data-
          base file.  A subset of words can be selected from the total
          set of 150837 words which fall within  specified  ranges  of
          the  properties  of  words  classified  in the database. The
          filter can output either the entire record for  a  word,  or
          any set of the properties.

          using  this  filter in conjunction with UNIQ, GREP, SORT and
          other UNIX and UNIX|STAT  filters.  Artificial  Intelligence
          researchers  can  produce reduced dictionaries of restricted
          word sets and relevant properties using this filter.

          _#g_#e_#t_#e_#n_#t_#r_#y

          The _#g_#e_#t_#e_#n_#t_#r_#y tool complements the  _#d_#i_#c_#t  tool,  in  that  it
          select  the  linguistic properties from the dictionary for a
          given set of words, rather than the words which fall  within
          values for specified properties.

          _#P_#s_#y_#c_#h_#D_#i_#c_#t

          The complete dictionary is large at  11MByte.  This  program
          reduces  it  to contain only those entries for which psycho-
          logical measures are available. This program can  produce  a
          smaller  dictionary  which  will  be sufficient for the con-
          struction of psycholinguistic stimuli,  but  may  not  serve
          other purposes to which the whole dictionary can be put. The
          dictionary which results  from  using  this  tool  is  about
          3MByte  of  sequential  UNIX  file  and contains entries for
          39300 words.
